# Blockchain from Scratch

PoW Blockchain implentation in Rust.

General idea was to fully understand technical blockchain mechanism by implementing one from scratch.

### Description :

- **main.rs** : running basic tasks of the blockchain
- **lib.rs** : basic bytes functions needed in the program
- **hashable.rs** : trait checking if data is hashable before adding it to the block / network
- **block.rs** : main implementation, blockchain characteritics

Thanks to both Blockchain and Rust communities for information provided online.
